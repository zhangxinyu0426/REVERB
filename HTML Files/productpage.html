            <h1 class="infotitle">USER 1</h1>
            <h2 class="infoinput">This is a superb instrument, with all the outstanding tone that is said to come with a top-end very old electric guitar or bass. The quality of engineering is very high so the harmonics are outstanding. The refinish is also top quality and somewhat aged so the bass looks both incredibly beautiful and authentic. It is highly resonant, plays stunningly well, sounds as good as it looks: loud and punchy, but with much tonal variation. It greatly helps that the bass was so well looked after by the previous owner, who really knew what he was doing. Excellent value.</h2>
 
             <h1 class="infotitle">USER 2</h1>
             <h2 class="infoinput">I recently purchased plays and sounds wonderful! Intonation and Vibrato is adjusted just perfectly. The pickups sound incredible and the guitar finish and fit are flawless! I feel the new features make these Strats one of the best I've ever owned.</h2>
 
             <h1 class="infotitle">USER 3</h1>
             <h2 class="infoinput">This guitar blew me away! I have owned strata in the past and this bar far is the best. The neck profile and finish are outstanding! The addition of the push tone knob to blend the neck pickup with the bridge and middle positions is crazy good. This one went on record the second day I owned it. It even rivals the Mayer versions I had. Kudos Fender!</h2>
            
            <h1 class="infotitle">USER 4</h1>
            <h2 class="infoinput">This pro 2's push push feature is incredible. The biting tone of a bridge pickup with the perfect amount of neck pickup blended in. It's a tone that sings perfection to the inner ear. I'm blown away. ...by far the best sounding/playing Fender I've played yet. I love it !</h2>
